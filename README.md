## [Inductive Chain Learning (Scaffolding or Instructional Scaffolding)](https://t.ly/UAiPa)

The idea revolves around a learning process where solving one problem or mastering one concept gradually exposes you to new concepts or techniques that are necessary to tackle subsequent problems. This iterative process helps build a deeper understanding of a subject over time.

In essence, inductive chain learning leverages the cumulative nature of knowledge acquisition. Each problem solved or concept learned lays the groundwork for tackling more complex problems in the future. This approach is commonly seen in fields like mathematics, programming, and even language learning, where foundational knowledge is essential for understanding more advanced topics.
